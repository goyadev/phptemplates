Assessment 1: Task 2 â€“ Template System
Using PHP as a Template System
1. Make a simple web site with at least 3 types of pages (you may include a landing page, a
gallery page and a contact page).
a. All types shall share a common masthead (Template), header, footer and
navigation.
2. Make a page controller (index.php), for each page and set the title, heading and other
data in variables.
3. Make a master template for every type of page that in turn will include the smaller page
parts. (All data can be considered safe for this exercise, making filtering, and escaping
unnecessary)
4. As best practice Validate the html source in W3Validator.
